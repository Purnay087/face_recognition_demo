# face_verification_demo
This is a simple example for face verification using [facenet : A unified Embedding for face recognition &amp; clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) implemented by davidsandberg.

## Requirements

## Models (pretrained)


## Inspiration

## MTCNN Face Alignment
Multi Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks performs face detection along with detection landmarks (eyes, nose & mouth endpoints). They provide a very high accuracy in real time. MTCNN leverages cascaded architectures with three stages of carefully designed deep convolutional networks to predict the same.
Refer to [README.md inside mtcnn_src dir](./mtcnn_src/README.md) to understand its model architecture.

## Overview of the Model

## Training on your own dataset
